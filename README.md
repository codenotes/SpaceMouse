# SpaceMouse
SpaceMouse is cool, but its software and drivers are terrible. Nothing every seems work reliably excepting a handful of CAD packages.  So have written a win32 layer that talks to mouse directly, and will feed forward to a vJoy virutal joystick so as to be able to use 3d spacemouse in anything.
